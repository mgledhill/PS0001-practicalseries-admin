## The website structure

Each publication in the Practical Series of Publications has a designated four digit project number in the following format:

```PSXXXX```

The four digits ```XXXX``` determine what type of publication the project represents. The following are the broad categories represented by this number:

| ```PS0001```      | Global Administration
| ```PS0002-0499``` | Reserved
